  <h1>Solutions &amp; Services</h1>
  <p>
    Supply chains today are unpredictable. Tariffs, regulatory changes and rising costs have added complexity to global logistics. 
    Warehousing, transportation, inventory, procurement and last-mile delivery now span multiple systems and partners, while many 
    companies still rely on manual processes and legacy tools. Those silos make it hard to see what is actually happening, slow 
    decisions down and hide the real causes of delays and cost overruns. At the same time, downtime can cost tens of thousands of 
    dollars per hour in lost production, and poor spare-parts planning only amplifies the damage. This page introduces OPC Warehouse 
    Solutions’ program-level approach: integrating inventory control, parts management, refurbishment and logistics into a single, 
    disciplined system that reduces downtime, increases reliability and keeps operations running under pressure.

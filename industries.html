  <h1>Industries &amp; Use Cases</h1>
  <p>
    Every industry experiences the impact of supply-chain disruption differently, but the stakes are always high. Manufacturers face
    steep losses when a single production line goes down. Utilities and energy operators must maintain uninterrupted service in
    environments where reliability and safety are non-negotiable. Field service and heavy-equipment teams operate under tight windows,
    remote locations and specialized part requirements that cannot be addressed with last-minute scrambling. Meanwhile, expectations for
    faster delivery and precise ETAs continue to rise. This page highlights how OPC Warehouse Solutions adapts its disciplined
    operational approach. Inventory control, kitting, refurbishment and high-visibility logistics—to the unique demands, risk profiles
    and regulatory conditions of each industry we serve.

        <p>Spare parts keep production moving, yet many maintenance teams struggle with missing or disorganized inventory. Loss of accuracy in machine spare parts inventory can shut down production just as quickly as having no parts, and downtime due to missing parts is pure profit loss. Vendor managed inventory (VMI) offers a solution by shifting stock management to suppliers and leveraging real time data to maintain ideal stock levels.</p>

        <h2>Spare parts challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inventory chaos.</strong> Maintenance teams often cannot find parts quickly; sometimes the needed part simply isn’t in the storeroom.</li>
          <li><strong>Production risks.</strong> Inaccurate spare parts inventories can halt production lines.</li>
          <li><strong>Profit impact.</strong> Every minute spent searching for parts or waiting for replenishment erodes profits and delays customer commitments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How VMI works</h2>
        <p>Vendor managed inventory is a data driven arrangement in which suppliers manage inventory levels of their products at the customer’s site. Suppliers use real time sales and demand data to optimize shipments and maintain high in stock rates. Before launching a VMI program, both parties agree on KPIs (turnover rate, stock to sales ratio, min/max levels), roles and shared technology. Suppliers handle replenishment, freeing the customer from deciding order size or timing, while the supplier retains ownership of inventory stored on site.</p>

        <h2>Benefits for multi site networks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Streamlined inventory management.</strong> Transferring stock management to suppliers simplifies operations and reduces the time spent on manual stock control.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced carrying costs.</strong> VMI optimizes stock levels to meet demand, lowering storage costs and releasing working capital.</li>
          <li><strong>Precise scheduling and timely replenishment.</strong> Real time data allow suppliers to schedule production and restock just in time.</li>
          <li><strong>Stronger partnerships.</strong> The collaborative nature of VMI fosters trust and long term relationships between buyers and suppliers.</li>
          <li><strong>Optimized inventory levels and resilience.</strong> When suppliers see real time demand, they can maintain ideal stock levels and help build a more resilient supply chain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implementing VMI across sites</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Assess critical spares.</strong> Identify high impact parts and determine min/max levels for each site. Use historical failure and consumption data to calibrate inventory targets.</li>
          <li><strong>Select and onboard suppliers.</strong> Choose suppliers with the capability and commitment to managing site inventory. Define KPIs and communication protocols in formal agreements.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrate systems.</strong> Implement shared technology to exchange real time sales, demand, and inventory data.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor performance.</strong> Track availability, stock turns, and response times. A well managed VMI program should achieve high availability (e.g., 99% across multiple sites) while minimizing stockouts and obsolescence.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjust governance.</strong> Maintain clear escalation rules and audit processes. Align min/max thresholds and replenishment triggers with changing demand patterns.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Through vendor managed inventory, organizations can secure critical spares, reduce downtime, and improve cost efficiency across all sites. The combination of accurate data, clear agreements, and collaborative partnerships turns spare parts management into a competitive advantage.</p>

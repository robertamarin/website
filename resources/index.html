  <h1>Resources &amp; Insights</h1>
  <p>
    Strong operational decisions depend on clear, practical information—not scattered anecdotes or disconnected data points. Many
    teams know they are losing time and money to downtime, expedite spend, inventory issues and unclear processes, but they lack
    concise resources that translate those problems into actionable solutions. This page brings together focused, data-driven briefs
    designed to help leaders understand root causes, evaluate risks and adopt proven operational practices. Whether the goal is to
    reduce downtime, improve parts planning, streamline refurbishment or strengthen logistics visibility, these insights provide
    fast, usable guidance that teams can apply immediately across their operations.
